        <br>
        <p>Fact-checking has become more important than ever in the age of social media. To keep from being deceived by
            false information, it is imperative for journalists to verify the authenticity of online content among
            widespread, unconfirmed reports.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Misinformation and disinformation are two concepts that are often got mistaken, said Isa Sonnenfeld, who
            leads the Google News Lab for the DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) region. “Misinformation is
            information that’s false, but the person who’s disseminating it believes that it’s true,” Sonnenfeld quoted
            the definitions summarized by their co-founding initiative, <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/">First
                Draft</a>>, which is a global nonprofit
            coalition addressing information disorder.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>On the other hand, “disinformation is information that’s false, and the person who’s disseminating it knows
            it’s false. It is a deliberate, intentional lie.” Sonnenfeld explained differentiating them from fake news.
            “We should always keep that in mind. The way we talk about it also sends a signal to the readers of the
            content. We should worry about how politicians play with the word ‘fake news.’”
        </p>
        <br>
        <figure>
            <img src="../images/essay4/image2.jpg">
            <figcaption>A hovercraft-landing photo published by Korean Central News Agency in March 2013 is shown as an
                example of manipulated content.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>Sonnenfeld listed eight motivations why false information is created and shared: poor journalism, parody,
            provoking, passion, partisanship, profit, political influence, and propaganda. Journalists have to identify
            the roles of different players in the game, she said. “When I’m not one hundred per cent sure that this is
            based on facts, I should always ask myself: Who is sharing? Who is spreading information? What could be the
            motivation behind it?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>On top of analyzing possible motivations, tracking down the source of viral images and videos is essential to
            fact-checking. “Originals matter,” Sonnenfeld said. When searching for the source of online content, she
            suggested journalists evaluate the plausibility of the uploaders. “We need to answer a few questions: Was
            the uploader present at the scene of the happening? Is the description consistent with other reports?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the report by the German General Social Survey 2018, the average satisfaction with democracy
            among different age groups in West Germany is higher than that in East Germany. All groups are satisfied
            with democracy in Germany. The older the age, the higher the satisfaction score of people in West Germany.

            <figcaption>Timestamps displaying on social media can be a useful tool to find out the earliest account.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Previously on the Forum, a U.S. computer scientist, Jaron Lanier, put it bluntly that Google and other tech
            giants “don’t care about the press or democracy or civilization.” While the top tech companies are in a race
            to dominate artificial intelligence, they “fundamentally don’t spend much time talking about your concerns”
            because they view everything else as “distraction,” Lanier said.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Sonnenfeld defended Google’s standpoint on democracy. "Everyone who works at the company cares about
            democratic values. This goes back to the company's mission: to provide and give access to relevant
            information," Sonnenfeld said. Interacting with media organizations and political organizations helps to
            build Google’s products in a better way, she added.

        <p>While Google has launched various tools and indicators for users to recognize quality content, introducing
            the Fact Check tag to Google search results is still an ongoing process in many places, Google News Lab’s
            Isa Sonnenfeld said.
