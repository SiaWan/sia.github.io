        <h2>30 Years after Fall of Berlin War</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The West and East side of Germany reconciled as the Berlin Wall was torn down thirty years ago. Yet, social
            disparities are still existing between the two poles, as observed from the two former capital cities, Berlin
            and Bonn.

        <p>Flashback thirty years ago, East Germany, formerly called the German Democratic Republic, held Berlin as
            capital, while Bonn was the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, also known as West Germany.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the capital of Germany after the fall of Berlin Wall. Berlin is a well-rounded city. Historical
            architectures, high-tech industries and festival events can all be found in this international city. </p>
        <br>
        <p>After losing the recognition as the capital, Bonn is famous for being the birthplace of Ludwig van Beethoven.
            Bonn becomes a city of Beethoven and a place full of arts and culture. Around the Beethoven house, there are
            different museums, churches and cultural activities happening.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Germany brings two places and people together in the past. People have different thoughts on reunification
            nowadays. </p>

        <p>George Wagemann, 50, who was born in Bonn, felt very proud to bring down the Berlin Wall because of the
            freedom in Germany nowadays but still regretted Bonn of losing the status of being the capital of Germany.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“I think it is a big loss for Bonn. It was an international city with people from all over the world. And now
            we missed it.” he said. “But I enjoy the time when I can travel around the world freely and the freedom of
            expression under democracy.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to the report by the German General Social Survey 2018, the average satisfaction with democracy
            among different age groups in West Germany is higher than that in East Germany. All groups are satisfied
            with democracy in Germany. The older the age, the higher the satisfaction score of people in West Germany.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It has been 30 years away from the destruction in November 1991. Germans and tourists from all over the world
            visit Berlin Wall to catch a glimpse of this remarkable history.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Throughout the year of the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall Fall, events including exhibitions, films and
            sports campaigns are held to celebrate this memorial historical moment in Germany. </p>
