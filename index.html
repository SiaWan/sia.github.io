        <p>Young activists, Ludwing Moncada from Nicaragua and Nanjira Sambuli from Kenya leverage digital media as a
            tool to stand up against massive political repression and bring changes in the society.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The two utilized digital media to engage and empower young people to connect and participate in the
            political movement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“In term of policy change, we try to inform people about the issues of why the internet is expensive and
            share the information for people to engage and use online and offline engagement for people to work
            together and address some of the challenges.” Said Sambuli.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“We started using our cell phones as if it is our weapon because information can change it all,” said Ludwig
            Moncada, a political activist from northern Nicaragua.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Days of mass protest in Nicaragua prompted in April 2018 has led to the death of at least <b class="text-danger">322</b>
            people. <b class="text-danger">23</b> of
            them were <b class="text-danger">children or teenagers</b>, and hundreds are criminalised according to <a
                href="https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2018/187.asp">Inter-American Commission on
                Human Rights</a>.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>That is the cause of standing against Nicaragua's political regime. Protesters hope to end Daniel Ortega’s,
            president of Nicaragua, dictatorship. Furious Nicaraguans have called for strikes and occupied universities
            to rise against Ortega’s authoritative punishment to people who oppose him.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Moncada was amongst the protesters that want to put the death of young protesters on halt. He and his team
            members founded HORA CE:RO, a political justice campaign that produces and spread political information
            through the digital platform that caters to adolescent age 12 to 16.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Even though traditional media covered the situation, but it is simply not enough,” said Moncada.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The campaign aims to spread the news about the protest to a larger audience and provide a safe space for
            political involvement by transitioning from protesting on the street to online.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Take “Piquetes” as an example, which means protesting in five minutes. This is HORA CE:RO’s new strategy to
            show their opposition against the political regime. Netizens can share their short videos of them singing
            the national anthem while holding the national flag to show agitation. Moncada said this can prevent
            further killing of the youth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The campaign is highly active on social media platforms such as Twitter, Youtube and their own website.
            Besides updates on news, the campaign shares digital art and videos posted by protesters on their platform.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Moncada shares that every like, every retweet and every hashtag plays a part in empowering youth to get
            their voices heard by policymakers.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Although a single tweet might seem insignificant the accumulative numbers of interactions in social media
            have brought wider influence in youth social participation that has brought them out from typing in the
            online world to voicing out and taking a strike in the real world.
            Nanjira Sambuli, senior policy manager from the Web Foundation, Kenya used digital media to advocate for
            digital equality locally and globally.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “We try to inform the public about the issues of why the internet is expensive and share the information
            for people to engage and use online and offline engagement for people to work together and address the
            challenges.” Said Sambuli.

            media.

        <br>
        <p>
            “The WEB foundation successfully gets the UN to ratify what affordable internet and part of the process is
            that the engagement of community to understand for themselves on a personal level - why the internet should
            be affordable to you, here is the data that you can use to advocate for yourself and why there is a need to
            address this issues.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “In a country like Nigeria, the government trying to make the mobile phone more expensive. Through online
            and offline engagement, we are able to lobby the government to create affordable internet.”

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“Using data - the story people share online and offline, compiling those and using those for actual
            engagement have been very successful.” She added.
