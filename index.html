            Young activists, Ludwing Moncada from Nicaragua, Tsetse Tleane from South Africa and Nanjira Sambuli from
            Kenya leverage digital media as a tool to stand up against massive political repression and bring changes
            in the society.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They utilized digital media to engage and empower young people to connect and participate in political
            movements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “We started using our cell phones as if it is our weapon because information can change it all,” said
            Ludwig
            Moncada, a political activist from northern Nicaragua.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Days of mass protest in Nicaragua prompted in April 2018 has led to the death of at least <b class="text-danger">322</b>
            people. <b class="text-danger">23</b> of
            them were <b class="text-danger">children or teenagers</b>, and hundreds are criminalised according to <a
                href="https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2018/187.asp">Inter-American Commission on
                Human Rights</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That is the cause of standing against Nicaragua's political regime said Moncada. Protesters hope to end the
            dictatorship of the president of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega. Furious Nicaraguans have called for strikes and
            occupied universities to rise against Ortega’s authoritative punishment to people who oppose him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moncada was amongst the protesters who wanted to put the death of young protesters on halt. He and his team
            members founded HORA CE:RO, a political justice campaign that caters to adolescent age 12 to 16. Their
            initiative is to raise political awareness through the digital platform.
        </p>

                    </i></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            “Even though traditional media covered the situation, but it is simply not enough,” said Moncada.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The campaign spreads the news about the social movement on social media, in hopes to provide a safe space
            for political involvement by transitioning from protesting on the street to online.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Take “Piquetes” as an example, which means protesting in five minutes. This is HORA CE:RO’s new strategy to
            show their opposition against the political regime. Netizens can share short videos of them singing the
            national anthem while holding the national flag to show agitation. Moncada said this can prevent further
            killing of the youth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The campaign is highly active on social media platforms such as Twitter, Youtube and <a href="https://www.horacero.org">their
                own website</a>. Besides updates on news, the campaign shares digital art and videos posted by
            protesters on their platform.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moncada said every like, every retweet and every hashtag plays a part in empowering youth to get their
            voices heard by policymakers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Media cooperate young people and it is important to let young people play the role they can play,” said
            Tsetse Tleane, a crime awareness advocate from South Africa.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Tleane is a technical advisor of Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit, an organisation that
            mobilises and train young people to lead violence prevention activities in Africa where youth are the top
            of the perpetrators of violent crime.

        </figure>
        <p>
            The organization’s youth crime prevention desk utilized the convenience of mobile phone and created an app
            to engage young people to become a “solution-driver” of crime prevention. The app also provides a step by
            step guide for users to hold crime prevention activities within their own community.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            According to <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2019/01/digital-2019-global-internet-use-accelerates">Digital
                2019 report</a>, 52% of the world population are mobile internet users. Middle and Eastern
            Africa have the lowest internet users in the world. Nanjira Sambuli, a digital equality advocate from
            Kenya, strived to bring universal access of internet that is portable, affordable and in reach for
            everybody.
        </p>
        <br>
        <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
        <p>
            Sambuli is a senior policy manager of the World Wide Web Foundation which used digital media to advocate
            for digital equality locally and globally. They aim to make internet access meaningful, where free flow
            access to information is available globally.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Using data - the story people share online and offline, compiling those and using those for actual
            engagement have been very successful.” She added.
        </p>

        </figure>     
        <p>
            “In a country like Nigeria, the government is trying to make the mobile phone more expensive. Through
            online and offline engagement, we are able to lobby the government to create affordable internet,” said
            Sambuli.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The foundation has started an online campaign where people can share their memories on the first-time they
            use the internet. The world-renowned entrepreneur like Bill Gates has also taken part in sharing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Online and offline engagement works hand in hand with each other,” said Sambuli. The global engagement of
            this campaign encourages people to address the barriers to digital access in their own communities by
            implementing the practice of digital equality in other countries.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Sambuli and her foundation were able to make a policy change in Kenya through the use of digital media. <a
                href="https://webfoundation.org/2018/01/un-broadband-commission-adopts-new-target-for-affordable-internet/">The
                WEB foundation</a> successfully got the United Nations to ratify affordable internet.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            She said the policy is never a quick win, it might take many years to remove censorship and bring equality
            to the world. Through the digital platform, the campaign can convert citizens in developed countries to
            become contributors to this movement and see the less developed country as an equal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “I don’t know how it will work before the internet maybe through radio and pen pail, but now anyone can be
            a source of inspiration and a source of friendship. That’s why we have to keep fighting for this as a
            possibility for everyone.”
